# API Casting Agency Capstone Udacity

This API is an option of the capstone project defined in the Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree Program. The Casting Agency models a company that is responsible for creating movies and managing and assigning actors to those movies. The motivation is to develop a system to simplify and streamline the process work of the Executive Producer within the company.

## Getting Started

### Pre-requisites and Local Development 
Developers using this project should already have Python3 and pip installed on their local machines.

#### Backend

This version of the API is only Backend; thus, the main folder concentrates all the required files.

From the main folder run `pip install requirements.txt`. All required packages are included in the requirements file.

The API relies on PostgreSQL database to store the data related to the Casting Agency API. To create the database run the following commands in a terminal:
```
psql
create database casting_agengy;
```

These commands will create the PostgreSQL database with the default configured name. Moreover, default postgress username and password are pre-configured. If you like to set a different name to the database or have a different username and password for PostgreSQL, please make sure to change this values in the `models.py`, `test_app.py`, and `setup.sh` files.

To run the application run the following commands: 
```
export FLASK_APP=app
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
```

These commands put the application in development and directs our API to use the `app.py` file in our main folder. Working in development mode shows an interactive debugger in the console and restarts the server whenever changes are made. If running locally on Windows, look for the commands in the [Flask documentation](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/tutorial/factory/).

The `app.py` includes two helpfull functions: `db_drop_and_create_all` and `prepopulate_db`. The first function helps to clean all registers in the database when deploying the API. It is unused by default. The second function helps to insert demo data into the database when there is no registers in it when deploying the API . This function is used as default.

The API runs on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` by default. To check that everything is working fine, in a browser introduce this URL and the message `Welcome to the Casting Agency "Films Udacity" API` will be displayed.

#### Authentication

This version of the API incorporates authentication via JWT Tokens generated by Auth0 (https://auth0.auth0.com/). In Auth0 the following Roles and Permissions were defined:
```
1) Casting Assistant
   - get:movies
   - get:actors

2) Casting Director
   - get:movies
   - get:actors
   - delete:actors
   - patch:actors
   - patch:movies
   - post:actors

3) Executive Producer
   - get:movies
   - get:actors
   - post:movies
   - post:actors
   - patch:movies
   - patch:actors
   - delete:movies
   - Delete:actors
```

Authorized JWT Tokens, with an expiration of 48 hours, for each role are:
```
1) Casting Assistant


2) Casting Director


3) Executive Producer
```

#### Frontend

This version of the API does not have a Frontend.

### Tests
This version of the application requires authentication via JWT Tokens (Auth0) for each previously mentioned user roles. JWT Tokens for each role can be modified in the `test_app.py` in the section identified as `Tokens`. Authorized JWT tokens were configured in `test_app.py`.

In order to run tests, first make sure that the API is runing wiht the `db_drop_and_create_all` function commented in the `app.py`. Then, in a terminal, navigate to the main folder and run the following commands: 

```
python3 test_app.py
```

All tests are kept in that file and should be maintained as updates are made to app functionality.

## API Reference

### Getting started

- Base URL: At present this app can only be run locally and it is not hosted as a base URL. The backend app is hosted at the default, http://127.0.0.1:5000/

- Authentication: This version of the application requires authentication via JWT Tokens (Auth0). 

### Error Handling

Erros are returned as JSON objects in the following format

```javascript
{
   "success": False, 
   "error": 422,
   "message": "unprocessable"

```

Currently the API will return four error types when requests fail:

- 405: Method not allowed
- 422: Not Processable
